Dotfiles (local)
================

After cloning this repo, run `install` to automatically set up the development
environment. Note that the install script is idempotent - running it multiple
times has no effect.

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.

This repository contains machine-specific configuration to accompany my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/Skylark95/dotfiles). The actual contents of this repository probably will not
be useful to anyone but me, but others may be interested in seeing how these
files are organized.
